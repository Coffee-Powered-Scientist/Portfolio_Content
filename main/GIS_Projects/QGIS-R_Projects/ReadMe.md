These 3 folders contain R code, QGIS Maps, and plotted statistical analysis for 3 different mini projects that I carried out.  They are all thrown in together in the same folder for easy access. If you would like to run the codes, please realize that they must be put into your QGIS-Rscripts folder. 



**Hydro_Analysis** contains a very easy-to-analyze test dataset showing water flow at different measured points in the soil. This is a straight forward univariate analysis, showcasing a basic understanding of QGIS-R interfacing and statistics. 



**Soil_Tox_Analysis** uses a built-in R test dataset, showing  soil contamination data for a small farm area in Belgium. (Meuse dataset). Univariate analyses are done here (for now). This shows an expansion of the kind of analysis done in Hydro_Analysis, having a more diverse dataset. 



**Nutrient_Map_USA** is a dataset pulled from (). It shows soil nutrient data for 3 soil horizons from several sites in the US.  This dataset runs both univariate and multivariate analyses, and seeks to group data by state, ecoregion, and other groupings for more nuanced analysis.
